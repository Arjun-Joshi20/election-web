What are the words that come to our mind: votes, polititians, new Government, new Prime Ministers, new Chief Miniseters and corruption. But when we seriously think of it election is basically an selection of a new Government in a particular area. It might be a country, city, state, village and there are even elections held in groups, cults and societies. Election takes part in a democracy where the people choose their own leader. Usually there is a person standing for a respective postition representing a particular party. The selection is done through a voting process and the person/party with the most votes takes the position.</h1>
